When you visit [KICC's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyatta_International_Convention_Centre#:~:text=David%20Mutiso) to view KICC’s Wikipedia page, the `#:~:text=some text fragment` syntax tells the browser to scroll to the provided text and highlight it.

Recently, Google Search has been returning some search results with such encoded links. It also works out well when you are sharing a link to particular text fragment. Try it out!
